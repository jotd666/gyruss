mockup.py: identify the orange sattelite bonus sprite codes and debug
display. OR it means that A000/A200 aren't copied fully into 4040 sub, 
dump should also dump 4040 sub state see if same than A000/A200

addr=$a04c, offset=$004c, X=118, Y=168, flipx=False, flip_y=True, code=01bd, color=08, name=bonus_satellite
addr=$a048, offset=$0048, X=118, Y=160, flipx=False, flip_y=True, code=00bd, color=08, name=bonus_satellite

- another possibility is to revert to explicitly calling 6809 code instead of interrupt => tried and failed!!

- optimize some 8 bit rols in 6809 code once it's good

- still small diffs amiga vs mame on memory blocks investigate
   47F2 ??
   6400, 6415, 6488, 64FF
- convert music: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/gyruss-arcade/01%2520BGM.mp3

- check attack wave params: log regs @ 4192

- implement difficulty
- stage numbers completely off after a while (9 => 0) ?? recheck
- chance stage enemies don't appear
- chance stage bonus text digits are off

- implement context switching (test first on startup!)
- log sprites/flash when missing

- what do they do? A7FD & A7FC

- update sprites: if Y = 0 don't display (spriteram offset 0) ??
- update sprites: symmetry flags wrong (see player ship)


- game state reverse: 082f jump table & other jump tables
- 32 colors => 16 + attached sprites?
- star effect: hack with pixel placement when detected in the sprite update
  (takes too much blitter time!)
- restore buffer to get rid of but then tiles would need
  redrawing when crossing paths with sprites
  OR hack something for title only / in-game: redraw parts of screen with non-blank

to turn off stars:

bpset 3804,,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}

turn off sprite semaphore/sync

bpset f0cd:sub,,{PC=$F0CF;g}

6809 converter: optim if 2 exactly identical GET_ADDRESS follow (no branches, just a "move/add"...
remove the second one
 
converter: .error: specify address/line
