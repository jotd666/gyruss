- blank tile doesn't always erase
- 32 colors => 16 + sprites?
- sprite erase doesn't work
- star effect how? sprites?? must be A200-xxxx
- restore buffer to get rid of but then tiles would need
  redrawing when crossing paths with sprites
  OR hack something for title only
- crash on demo start
- lives drawn at wrong location (start game)
