- A700/A701 semaphore system not working, do something else
  between cpus?
- check with earth only sprites, 0x4040 subcpu zone vs 0xA000...
- update sprites: if Y = 0 don't display (spriteram offset 0) ??
- update sprites: symmetry flags wrong (see player ship)
- ship materailization not visible/logged

- game state reverse: 082f jump table & other jump tables
- blank tile doesn't always erase
- 32 colors => 16 + attached sprites?
- sprite erase doesn't work all the time? (earth??)
- star effect how? sprites?? must be A200-xxxx
- restore buffer to get rid of but then tiles would need
  redrawing when crossing paths with sprites
  OR hack something for title only
