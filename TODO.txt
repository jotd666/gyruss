- stars interfere with other sprites / replacing them in the final
  sprite buffer. Very difficult to debug with all the pseudo-randomness
  and multi-cpu & double-buffered sprite system and different coordinate
  system on top of it.... so backup solution would probably be to turn off star management
  by the game and re-write the starfield on the amiga side
- after a good game (level 6+?...) next game ships attack wave
  is completely nuts. Protection? Z80 code? 6809 code? compare memory
  when starting game, see which RAM values are changed.
  losing at level 5 => game ok.
  
- profile cpu with MAME: trace without loop while playing, see where the cpu
  is spending a lot of time
  
- a few stars remaining in original sprites


- mixer routine to integrate

- highscore save
- still missing sprites, track red flashes
- invincivility: ok except for some rare cases to investigate: factorize the part F0 => 9000

- missing sounds: flash yellow
 
- convert music: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/gyruss-arcade/01%2520BGM.mp3


- log sprites/flash when missing



---------------------

to turn off stars:

bpset 3804,,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}
and reset

turn off sprite semaphore/sync:

bpset f0cd:sub,,{PC=$F0CF;g}

turn off music 25/27 and background humming:

bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27 || a == $2,{PC=$3803;g}

a=1: credit
a=6: attack wave sound

6809 converter: optim if 2 exactly identical GET_ADDRESS follow (no branches, just a "move/add"...
remove the second one
Z80 converter: .error: specify address/line
Z80 converter: jra/jmp (a0/a1/...) => .error
