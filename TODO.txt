- still small diffs amiga vs mame on memory blocks investigate
   47F2 ??
   6400, 6415, 6488, 64FF

- enemies attack but keep relatively small (no dashing on player...)
  trace cpu/debug around 282b
- implement difficulty
- end of level: locks up, ship doesn't go to the center either: implement
  level skip like MAME does to test better
- stars during title: not enough of them: find out why?
- implement context switching (test first on startup!)
- log sprites/flash when missing

- what do they do? A7FD & A7FC

- update sprites: if Y = 0 don't display (spriteram offset 0) ??
- update sprites: symmetry flags wrong (see player ship)


- game state reverse: 082f jump table & other jump tables
- 32 colors => 16 + attached sprites?
- star effect: hack with pixel placement when detected in the sprite update
  (takes too much blitter time!)

  redrawing when crossing paths with sprites
  OR hack something for title only / in-game: redraw parts of screen with non-blank
