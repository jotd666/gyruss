- stars interfere with other sprites / replacing them in the final
  sprite buffer. Very difficult to debug with all the pseudo-randomness
  and multi-cpu & double-buffered sprite system and different coordinate
  system on top of it.... so backup solution would probably be to turn off star management
  by the game and re-write the starfield on the amiga side
	
- lives erased maybe 248 is too low! => 240 in test

- implement putpixel for stars with plane selection (0-4) for stars (to prepare reimplementation)	 
- highscore save
- still missing sprites, track red flashes
- invincivility: ok except for some rare cases to investigate: factorize the part F0 => 9000

- missing sounds: flash yellow
 
- convert music: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/gyruss-arcade/01%2520BGM.mp3


- log sprites/flash when missing


- star effect: hack with pixel placement when detected in the sprite update
  (takes too much blitter time!):
  when updating sprites, if star found, then just bset. Color palette must be
  adjusted to have star colors in strategic positions 1,2,4,8
  when clearing, just clear byte


---------------------

to turn off stars:

bpset 3804,,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}
and reset

turn off sprite semaphore/sync:

bpset f0cd:sub,,{PC=$F0CF;g}

turn off music 25/27 and background humming:

bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27 || a == $2,{PC=$3803;g}

a=1: credit
a=6: attack wave sound
