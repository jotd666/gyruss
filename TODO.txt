- 32 colors => 16 + attached sprites? count colors of tiles & sprites independently
- when ship is fading out it appears too big when rotating anti-clockwise!)
- chance stage bonus text digits are off ??
- highscore: letters are flipped when entered
- add 10000 points cheat
- sometimes enemy sprites flashing/shifting
- death ray satellites position seem not aligned (maybe that is easier to debug)

- convert music: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/gyruss-arcade/01%2520BGM.mp3


- implement difficulty
- stage numbers completely off after a while (9 => 0) ?? recheck

- log sprites/flash when missing

- reduce memory (log tiles instead of including them all?)

- game state reverse: 082f jump table & other jump tables
- star effect: hack with pixel placement when detected in the sprite update
  (takes too much blitter time!)
- restore buffer: do it only in title screen and for some Y (score/credit+lives)
  do it if non-blank tile where "GAME OVER" or "X WARPS TO..."
  or "<planet name>" or "KONAMI copytight"
  if not activated, then pure delete
- upper screen chars blue "shadow". Is that restore from wrapped lower Y?

to turn off stars:

bpset 3804,,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}
and reset

turn off sprite semaphore/sync

bpset f0cd:sub,,{PC=$F0CF;g}
