- optim: make 6809 memory contiguous (only 6k wasted) 0x4000->0x6800
  make 0xA000 Z80 memory at some different offset to match 6809 0x6000
  first: avoid the subing 4000/6000 by pre-subbing the A5/A6 pointers
  6809 differentiate ROM and RAM to avoid memory comparisons 4000/6000/E000
  but all that only in RELEASE!!
  
- missing warp to planet sfx
- weapon upgrade sound not played
- option to turn off stars
- clear bitplane note the zero bitplanes to avoid clearing the bitplanes: doesn't work properly
- handle loop (radio): when to stop it? maybe if sound 0 played
  then stop loops and music (not regular SFX)
- highscore save
- invincivility: ok except for some rare cases to investigate: factorize the part F0 => 9000

- missing sounds: flash yellow
- add ignored sound flag
 
- convert music: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/gyruss-arcade/01%2520BGM.mp3

---------------------

to turn off stars:

bpset 3804,,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}
and reset

turn off sprite semaphore/sync:

bpset f0cd:sub,,{PC=$F0CF;g}

turn off music 25/27 and background humming:

bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27 || a == $2,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27 || a == $2 || a == $a,{PC=$3803;g}

log sounds:

bpset 5c38,,{printf "%x",A;g}

- to redirect "credit" sound to any sound
bpset 5c38,,{A=xxx;g}

remove the second one
