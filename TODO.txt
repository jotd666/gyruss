- sometimes enemy sprites flashing/shifting: understand better the sprite "double
  buffering" that the game does
  => debug when "NEPTUNE" is shown: write to 0x100 during sprite update, find the disappearing
     pieces log the memory with A701/A702 values
  
- highscore save
- 32 colors => 16 + attached sprites? count colors of tiles & sprites independently
- use hardware sprites for player ship maybe uses less colors
  (specially when exploding, could be done by a palette change if we just
  use the sprite allocation routine)
- highscore: letters are flipped when entered

- invincivility: ok except for some rare cases to investigate: factorize the part F0 => 9000
- restore buffer: do it only in title screen and for some Y (score/credit+lives)
  do it if non-blank tile where "GAME OVER" or "X WARPS TO..."
  or "<planet name>" or "KONAMI copytight"
  if not activated, then pure delete
  * debug with a background color to indicate the current mode

- missing sounds: flash yellow
 
- convert music: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/gyruss-arcade/01%2520BGM.mp3


- log sprites/flash when missing


- star effect: hack with pixel placement when detected in the sprite update
  (takes too much blitter time!)


---------------------

to turn off stars:

bpset 3804,,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}
and reset

turn off sprite semaphore/sync:

bpset f0cd:sub,,{PC=$F0CF;g}

turn off music 25/27 and background humming:

bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27 || a == $2,{PC=$3803;g}

a=1: credit
a=6: attack wave sound
