- still small diffs amiga vs mame on memory blocks investigate
   47F2 ??
   6400, 6415, 6488, 64FF

- check attack wave params: log regs @ 4192

- enemies attack but keep relatively small (no dashing on player...)
- same issue with death ray satellites: they never move forward. Find where they are updated
  in MAME should be easier, and maybe it's the same issue!!
  
- implement difficulty
- end of level: ship doesn't go to the center properly
- "X WARPS TO XXXX" only works for first planet (NEPTUNE): check when it's written in MAME for later
  stages
- stage numbers completely off after a while (9 => 0)
- chance stage bonus text digits are off

- implement context switching (test first on startup!)
- log sprites/flash when missing

- what do they do? A7FD & A7FC

- update sprites: if Y = 0 don't display (spriteram offset 0) ??
- update sprites: symmetry flags wrong (see player ship)


- game state reverse: 082f jump table & other jump tables
- 32 colors => 16 + attached sprites?
- star effect: hack with pixel placement when detected in the sprite update
  (takes too much blitter time!)
- restore buffer to get rid of but then tiles would need
  redrawing when crossing paths with sprites
  OR hack something for title only / in-game: redraw parts of screen with non-blank

to turn off stars:

bpset 3804,,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}
