- on explosion, seems that there's a mixup between stars
  and explosion bits. Check with stars off
  some 6809 code is explosion specific I seem to remember
- better optimization: remove the last clear of sprite buffer,
  use a counter instead
- clear if blitter busy use cpu clear like dragonninja
- clear bitplane note the zero bitplanes to avoid clearing the bitplanes
- zooming into Saturn, Earth, etc... enable restore (Neptune 860A: no need as planet is 100% a sprite)
  for other planets it doesn't seem to work
- proper start level cheat  

- mixer routine to integrate: in progress

- after a good game (level 6+?...) next game ships attack wave
  is different. Protection? Z80 code? 6809 code? compare memory
  when starting game, see which RAM values are changed.
  losing at level 5 => game ok. 8 => different

- highscore save
- still missing sprites, track red flashes
- invincivility: ok except for some rare cases to investigate: factorize the part F0 => 9000

- missing sounds: flash yellow
 
- convert music: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/gyruss-arcade/01%2520BGM.mp3


- log sprites/flash when missing



---------------------

to turn off stars:

bpset 3804,,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}
and reset

turn off sprite semaphore/sync:

bpset f0cd:sub,,{PC=$F0CF;g}

turn off music 25/27 and background humming:

bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27 || a == $2,{PC=$3803;g}

a=1: credit
a=6: attack wave sound

6809 converter: optim if 2 exactly identical GET_ADDRESS follow (no branches, just a "move/add"...
remove the second one
Z80 converter: .error: specify address/line
Z80 converter: jra/jmp (a0/a1/...) => .error
