- sometimes enemy sprites flashing/shifting: understand better the sprite "double
  buffering" that the game does
  it's related to stars as if stars are off it doesn't happen
  => debug when "NEPTUNE" is shown: write to 0x100 during sprite update, find the disappearing
     pieces log the memory with A701/A702 values
     W $100 $DE
	 writes to 101
	 
	 
- neptune planet fails to display: save A000=>A800
  and load memory in MAME at 6000, see if 4040 ends up trashed
    - if so => 6809 code issue
	- if not => Z80 code issue
	
- lives erased maybe 248 is too low!
	 
- highscore save
- highscore: letters are flipped when entered: seems fixed

- invincivility: ok except for some rare cases to investigate: factorize the part F0 => 9000
- restore buffer: TODO: force if "KONAMI copyright"

- missing sounds: flash yellow
 
- convert music: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/gyruss-arcade/01%2520BGM.mp3


- log sprites/flash when missing


- star effect: hack with pixel placement when detected in the sprite update
  (takes too much blitter time!):
  when updating sprites, if star found, then just bset. Color palette must be
  adjusted to have star colors in strategic positions 1,2,4,8
  when clearing, just clear byte


---------------------

to turn off stars:

bpset 3804,,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}
and reset

turn off sprite semaphore/sync:

bpset f0cd:sub,,{PC=$F0CF;g}

turn off music 25/27 and background humming:

bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27 || a == $2,{PC=$3803;g}

a=1: credit
a=6: attack wave sound

6809 converter: optim if 2 exactly identical GET_ADDRESS follow (no branches, just a "move/add"...
remove the second one
Z80 converter: .error: specify address/line
Z80 converter: jra/jmp (a0/a1/...) => .error
