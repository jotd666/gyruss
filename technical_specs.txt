The original game uses 28 different colors, but only 16 different
colors for sprites, which is good!

So the amiga display uses 32 colors but only 16 colors are assigned
to BOBs which saves some blitting.
The stars are originally sprites, but now converted to a 
single pixel on only 1 bitplane, which makes drawing super-fast.
The possible colors range from white to blue (5 colors) so by using
palette entries 1,2,4,8,16 it's possible to display them with a single
BSET instruction (and clear them with a simple CLR.B)

The fonts/tiles use the rest of the colors, so they're displayed
using the 5 bitplanes.

Display is double-buffered

The game detects when there are fonts/planets in the middle of the
playfield, and uses blit clear instead of background restore
(which is the active mode when playing)

No copper tricks or hardware sprites are used.
